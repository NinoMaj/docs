## Overview

At Prisma, some of the _improvements_ that are made in a release may come with _breaking changes_. A breaking change means that you're required to adjust some parts of your project after having upgraded to the a new Prisma version (e.g. a change to the Prisma schema syntax or the Prisma Client API).

## How Prisma follows SemVer

Semantic Versioning (SemVer) uses the following rules for version upgrade (quoted from the [SemVer](https://semver.org/) spec):

_Given a version number `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`, increment the:_

1. _`MAJOR` version when you make incompatible API changes,_
1. _`MINOR` version when you add functionality in a backwards compatible manner, and_
1. _`PATCH` version when you make backwards compatible bug fixes._

Additional labels for pre-release and build metadata are available as extensions to the `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` format.

While Prisma releases follow the _format_ of the [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) (SemVer) specification, it does **not** follow the rule that `MINOR` version updates must not have incompatible API changes (i.e. _breaking changes_). This means that there _might_ be breaking changes in any `2.X` release.

## Philosophy

Since breaking changes are inevitable throughout Prisma releases, it is a core goal of Prisma to make the upgrade path for users as smooth as possible. This will be done through:

- dedicated tooling (e.g. to automatically convert to a new schema syntax)
- extensive upgrade guides that cover all possible scenarios during an upgrade process

> **Note**: In addition to this, we are currently evaluating the possibility of a formal `prisma upgrade` command in the Prisma CLI that will guide users through the upgrade process. Please [share your thoughts](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/2296) about this approach on GitHub.
